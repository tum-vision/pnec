# By default, there is no easy way in CMake to set the value of a cache
# variable without reinitialising it, which involves resetting its
# associated help string.  This is particularly annoying for CMake options
# where they need to programmatically updated.
#
# This function automates this process by getting the current help string
# for the cache variable to update, then reinitialising it with the new
# value, but with the original help string.
